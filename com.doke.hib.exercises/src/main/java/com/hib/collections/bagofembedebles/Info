1]Item has a collection of value types i.e a Collection of  objects of Image
2]Collection of Image objects is a ArrayList
3]Item 1---------* Image(value type)
4]Item id is stored as foreign key in image table
6]as collection is a ArrayList, order of ArrayList insertion is  preserved in DB table,Image
7]as duplicates are allowed in arraylist we need to create one more id column to distinguish
between rows in image table
