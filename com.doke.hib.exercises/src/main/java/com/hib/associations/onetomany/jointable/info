1]when to use join table:when one to many mapping is optional.
i.e user may have baught items or an item may not be bought by any user

2]unique = true for item_id_fk,because items bought by one user cannot be bought by other user.

3]nullable=false for item_id_fk,if users itemlist is set to null,it should not be saved to mapping table.

*always think of 
1]is association is optional or not.
2]is association is strictly unique.(unique true/false)
3]is saving null value in foreign key column allowed?(nullable true/false)
We always try to avoid nullable columns in
a relational database schema. Information that is unknown degrades the quality
of the data you store.

**imp: owner of relationship i.e item can update the association
				 * itm2rd assigned to another user and saved,and its association with previous user is changed to new user
