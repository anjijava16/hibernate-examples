1]Bags have the most efficient performance characteristics of all the collections
you can use for a bidirectional one-to-many entity association
2]By default, collections in Hibernate are
loaded only when they’re accessed for the first time in the application. Because a
bag doesn’t have to maintain the index of its elements (like a list) or check for
duplicate elements (like a set), you can add new elements to the bag without triggering
the loading.
3]This is an important feature if you’re going to map a possibly,large collection of entity references.
as no select query is executed while getting bag collection.

4]if you do not write a @joincolumn annotation then by default the owner tables gets,
weaker table name + weaker table id column name as a column for foreign key.

thus we get item_id in Bid table.
