
A Category has a Map of Item instances—the key of each map entry is a reference
to an Item. The value of each map entry is the User who added the Item to
the Category. This strategy is appropriate if there are no additional columns on
the join table; see the schema in figure 7.12.
The advantage of this strategy is that you don’t need any intermediate class, no
entity or value type, to represent the ADDED_BY_USER_ID column of the join table
in your Java application.
