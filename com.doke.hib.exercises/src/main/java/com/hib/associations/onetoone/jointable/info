when to use:
1]when you have optional one to one mapping between two entities.
ITEM 0-1------------------ 1SHIPMENT
2]when you have to add extra info about the asociation like,
when was it done,who did it.Instead of adding this information to any of the
two table.u can keep it in the middle table.
3]If optional=false:shipment has to have item entity in it,while saving,(i.e property cannot be null)
4]If optional=true:shipment may or may not have item entity in it.(i.e property can  be null)

shp.setItem(null);=not-null property references a null or transient value : com.hib.associations.onetoone.jointable.Shipment.item
